THIS ASSIGNMENT IS DUE ON 10/30/2023

Write a Python Program to read the names of the persons and their Date Of Births from the People_And_Their_DOBs.txt and produce an output file which will have the list of Names and his/ her Age sorted in Descending order similar to People_And_Their_DOBs_Output.txt file. You program will then also compare the output your program produced and the one is provided (People_And_Their_DOBs_Output.txt). If they are same then print "Matched and Verified", otherwise your Program will not be accepted.

The program MUST contain:

1. Multiple Functions, I can suggest few, for example: read_file, calculate_age, generate_output, compare_files etc . You can add other functions as 
you need. No restrictions on that. 

2. Program may use os and shutil modules for any file system related operation. This is preferred to have but not required though.

3. Program MUST use necessary functions from the datetime library for finding age and other date related calculations

4. Program MUST catch ValueError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, IOError and generic Exception

5. Program must have if __name__ == '__main__': checking

** DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED OUTPUT FILE
** READ ONLY FROM THE PROVIDED People_And_Their_DOBs.txt 
** YOUR OUTPUT FILE NAME SHOULD BE People_And_Their_DOBs_Output_YOURFIRSTNAME.txt
** Feel free to ask any questions you may have via Email or MS Teams DM
